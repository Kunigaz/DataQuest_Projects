This repository contains all the projects I completed with DataQuest.io:

- .html files are condensed (cuts out any excessively large output cells) versions of my Jupyter notebooks hat can easily be opened in the browser. 
   
- .ipynb files are the full version of the project and can be opened in Jupyter.

- each repo will also contain the data used for the given project, usually in .csv format.
